VAM (Virtual Art Museum) is a platform where you can possibly find many types of Eastern Post Soviet era Art and Architecture that is still present or was destroyed during the Second World War. This Project was aimed on proving an opportunity for people who appreciate the art of this period of history to enjoy and learn about the specimens that were created during this time in post soviet and socialism countries.
